This set of SlackBuilds should get Bumblebee up and running on a
Slackware based NVIDIA Optimus setup.


Slackware Docs:
  A wiki page on the Slackware docs has been put to gether by another
  slacker, TommyC. I recommend you follow the wiki page for a more
  in-depth guide.

HowTo:
  If you have never used a SlackBuild before, please refer to the HowTo
  on SlackBuilds.org: http://slackbuilds.org/howto/


Note:
  Several of these SlackBuilds support a COMPAT32 option which
  allows 32-bit binaries to be build and packaged.  This does
  require that the system is multilibbed, otherwise the
  SlackBuilds will fail.

  For more information on multilibbing visit AlienBOB's wiki:

1.  Download the sources:
      $ ./download.sh

2.  Create group: bumblebee:
      # groupadd bumblebee

    Add users to the group:
      # usermod -G bumblebee -a USERNAME

    Note: you will need to re-login as the user for this to take effect

3.  Build and install: libbsd

4.  Build and install: bumblebeed

5.  Build and install: bbswitch (Optional)

    This in an optional requirement.  If you do not need power management
    or the ability to turn off the nVidia chip, you can skip this.

6.  Build and install: libvdpau (Optional, if using nouveau)

7.  Build and install: nvidia-bumblebee (Optional, if using nouveau)

    If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
    libraries can be built via:

    # COMPAT32=yes ./nvidia-bumblebee.SlackBuild

8.  Build and install: nvidia-kernel (Optional, if using nouveau)

9.  Build and install: primus, VirtualGL, or both

    Primus:
      1. Rebuild and reinstall: mesa

         Slackware's mesa does not come with libglapi which is needed by
         primus during runtime.

         If the system is x86_64 based, a 32-bit compatible package can
         be built via:

         # ./mesa-compat32.SlackBuild

      2. Build and install: primus

         If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
         libraries can be built via:

         # COMPAT32=yes ./primus.SlackBuild

    VirtualGL:
      1. Build and install: libjpeg-turbo

         If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
         libraries can be built via:

         # COMPAT32=yes ./libjpeg-turbo.SlackBuild

      2. Build and install: VirtualGL

         If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
         libraries can be built via:

         # COMPAT32=yes ./VirtualGL.SlackBuild

10. Run the rc.bumblebee script:
     # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed
     # /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed start

    If you'd like to have bumblebee autostart with the system, you will
    need to add the following lines to: /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed ]; then
      /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed start
    fi

    You can also go a step further by having bumblebeed start with your
    system by adding the following lines to: /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed ]; then
      /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed stop
    fi

    Now an application can run with optirun:
     $ optirun glxgears
