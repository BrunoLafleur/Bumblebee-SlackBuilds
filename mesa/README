Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API very similar to that of
another well-known 3-D graphics library.  :-)  The Mesa libraries are
used by X to provide both software and hardware accelerated graphics.

This package is a "rebuilt" version of Slackware's Mesa enabling
libglapi.

If the system has mesa-compat32, mesa-compat32.SlackBuild can be used to
create a patched mesa-compat32 package.

Building mesa-compat32 requires llvm-compat32 for some of the gallium
drivers, and freeglut-compat32 for mesa-demos.

Creating llvm-compat32:
  # convertpkg-compat32 -i llvm-VERSION-i486-BUILD.txz
  # installpkg /tmp/llvm-compat32-VERSION-x86_64-BUILDcompat32.txz

Creating freeglut-compat32:
  # convertpkg-compat32 -i freeglut-VERSION-i486-BUILD.txz
  # installpkg /tmp/freeglut-compat32-VERSION-x86_64-BUILDcompat32.txz
