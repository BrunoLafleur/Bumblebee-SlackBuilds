# Primus-vk

This Vulkan layer can be used to do GPU offloading.
Typically you want to display an image rendered on a more powerful GPU on a display managed by an internal GPU.

It is basically the same as Primus for OpenGL (https://github.com/amonakov/primus).
However it does not wrap the Vulkan API from the application but is directly integrated
into Vulkan as a layer (which seems to be the intendend way to implement such logic).

## Usage

Run crazybee.sh to redo the Slackware Bumblebee packages.

You need to recompile nvidia-bumblebee which add libnvidia-glvkspirv.so library which is needed by primus_vk
